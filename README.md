# Data-Budget


## Deatails
My task of this project was to modify the starter code so that it becomes a payroll tracker. In order to do so, I used javascript functions to allow me add employees first name, last name, and salary. Once entered, the console should have an Array of the information I entered as well as the average gross. Some of the challenges I faced in the project was creating my for loop properly. With small adjustments in my code, I was able to get the application to function properly.
